This is the first Milestone Project for Udemy Course: 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla Head of Data Science at Pierian Training
It is a TicTacToe Game implemented in Python. There are two players filling markers in the display (O or X) turn by turn.

The code is mostly based in the course, with some improvements regarding functioning and error checking.
## Play
• Who plays first is randomly selected.  <br />
• The first player selects marker, X or O.  <br />
• When someone wins there is a printing indication in the console.  <br />
• If the board is full and none has won, it's a tie.  <br />
• When the game is over, there would be a message asking if you want to replay.
