This is the first Milestone Project for Udemy Course: 2022 Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python by Jose Portilla Head of Data Science at Pierian Training
It is a TicTacToe Game implemented in Python. There are two players filling markers in the display (O or X) turn by turn. 
## Code
The code is mostly based in the course, with some improvements regarding functioning and error checking.
## Play
• Who plays first is randomly selected.
• The first player selects marker, X or O.
• When someone wins there is a printing indication in the console.
• If the board is full and none has won, it's a tie.
• When the game is over, there would be a message asking if you want to replay.
